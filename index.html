Applying to college earlier than usual can come with various benefits, such as knowing about your admission status earlier, having fewer competitors when applying and having the rest of the year stress-free! Now with advantages come disadvantages, such as having to work twice as much to get applications earlier. While applying earlier can be great, there are two ways to apply early. Early decision and early action are different applications and it is very important to know the difference between the two. Early decision are for people who are one hundred percent decided on which college they want to go. This application can only be used in one college as it is binding: if the college accepts the application one must attend that college and cannot refuse. Early action on the other hand allows you to also apply early while not being a binding application.

                <h4 id="end4">When it comes it comes to applying to college one can apply with a regular application (at the
                    regular time) or you can apply earlier. Applying to college earlier than usual can come with
                    various benefits, such as knowing about your admission status earlier, having fewer competitors
                    when applying and having the rest of the year stress-free! Now with advantages come disadvantages,
                    such as having to work twice as much to get applications earlier. While applying earlier
                    can be great, there are two ways to apply early. Early decision and early action are different
                    applications and it is very important to know the difference between the two. Early decision
                    are for people who are one hundred percent decided on which college they want to go. This
                    application can only be used in one college as it is binding: if the college accepts the
                    application one must attend that college and cannot refuse. Early action on the other hand
                    allows you to also apply early while not being a binding application.

                <h4 id="end5">-College requirements vary a lot between the college you are applying for, but most of them share
                    some basic requirements. Here are some of them: a standarized test like the SAT or the ACT,a
                    high school transcript, certain SAT subject tests depending on which concentration you are
                    choosing in college (or an equivalent), a FAFSA application that colleges use in addition
                    to help them decide your financial aid, and an application for which to apply for the college.

                <h4 id="end6">-Financial aid is a very important topic when it comes to college. Almost all colleges require
                    the student to fill out a FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) if the student
                    wishes for financial aid. Finacial aid can come in various forms. Some of them come as grants,
                    loans, or work-study. Grants do not have to be repaid and are basically free money, while
                    loans must be payed back eventually. Work-study is a different type of aid that basically
                    gives the student some form of job which in turns helps pay for college.

                    money to attend college for a variaty of reasons. There is a scholarship for almost anything!
                    The only problem is that they can be hard to find, but thankfully now it shouldn't be.

                <h4 id="end8">-Finding the college for you is one of the hardest tasks. There are some things you should consider
                    though, such as the majors the college offers, how good the programs are in that college,
                    whether you want to stay close home or are willing to go far away, how much aid the college
                    offers, whether you are comfortable with the environment of the college, and many more! These
                    are just some questions and things to consider when choosing a college.

                <h4 id="end9">-Interviews can be nerve wrecking, but they really shoudln't be. One should treat them as normal
                    conversations, because they are! They aren't your typical conversations though, as you will
                    not be talking like you talk to your family or friends. One must act very respectful and
                    talk properly, bring all necessary documents, and know what you are talking about. Interviews
                    aren't necessary to get into college, but they can be very helpful as it lets the college
                    know who you really are. Check with your colleges if they offer interviews.

                    in our calendar. To get to our calendar, click on the word "Deadlines" at the top of the
                    page. If you want to keep up with your own deadlines, we suggest you make your own calendar

                    check such calendar every day can greatly help you keep track of yourself. If such calendar
                    is digital, make sure to set some form of alarm a week or so before said deadline. Good luck!</h4>
